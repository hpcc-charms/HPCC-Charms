Assume HPCC-Charms build under ~/work/build

Deployment scenarios:

There is "cloud-type" in config.yaml. For AWS set it to "aws" since there are some settings for AWS in environment.xml.
Also if deployed on AWS the 8010 port needed opened on esp node: ec2 security group

1) ./run_nodes
   juju status: make sure all nodes in "ready"
   ./add_relation_node
   juju status: make sure all nodes in "joined"
   juju config dali update-envxml="1"
   juju status:  make sure "HPCC started" on all nodes

2) ./run_cluster
   juju status: make sure all nodes in "ready"
   ./add_relation
   juju status: make sure all nodes in "joined"
   juju config dali update-envxml="1"
   juju status:  make sure "HPCC started" on all nodes

3) Case failed: run_cluster with a separated esp
   I will investigate it
